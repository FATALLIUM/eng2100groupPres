    <h1>Summary of chapter:</h1>
    <p>
        Our education systems have different focuses for different grades. Colleges and universities tend to focus more
        on writing compared to reading. This causes a separation of the connected practice and could lead to difficulty
        for students to comprehend text.
    </p>
    <p>Reading and writing have their own strengths as it allows students to create art from the understanding that they
        gain from the text. Reading enhances subjective thinking, active responding, and interpreting to new events or
        current events. </p>

    <p>However, there is more that should be done to improve studentsâ€™ ability to read as
        teaching reading and writing together would help students gain effective communication skills which are desired
        by employers.</p>

    <p>In addition, students live in an information-rich environment in which technology has contributed,
        the ability to write or read is degrading as more time is spent on texting and scrolling through social media.
