            maybe
            even a more essential role—in this digital age because of the proliferation of information.” (Carillo, 40)

    <p>We live in a Digital Age in which technology dominates our lives. When texting and tweeting become trends,
        grammar and sentence structure are left out to be optional.</p>
    <p>In addition to social media, people receive more information than ever before, this leads to an overload of
        unnecessary information which essentially damages the ability of comprehension and critical thinking.
    </p>

    <!-- PO: the growth of technology has both pros and cons; its convenience could be the reason for students’ lacking writing and reading skills. I think that social media is a main factor that people are struggling with, especially when they receive more information than they can process daily. As time passes, people are unable to slow down, they would resist reading a book because the time to read a book is equivalent to watching 50 short clips or even more on TikTok or YouTube. It turns out that people are blindly receiving information without understanding or processing it.   -->
