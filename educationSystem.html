            “Colleges and universities are potentially producing students, or citizens, who think reading is passive.
            These students might blindly accept whatever comes their way rather than actively engaging ideas, asking
            questions, and seeking out multiple perspectives.” (Carillo, 39)

    <p>Throughout elementary school, students are taught writing and reading simultaneously as it is important to know
        both to understand the other. The ability to comprehend a text with writing is an essential skill needed to move
        forward.
    </p>

    <p>As students leave elementary school and enter high school after a couple of years, they are taught something
        completely different about the connection of writing and reading. This causes students to struggle with their
        writing as they are no longer able to comprehend what they are reading.</p>

    <p>Teachers and professors are upset by the poor writing skills of their students, but they don’t acknowledge that
        the student is struggling due to the lack of attention given to improving student’s ability to read. </p>
