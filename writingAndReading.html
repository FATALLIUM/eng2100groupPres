    <p>Without the ability to read writings, texts may just seem to be a jumble of words that make sense but are not
        comprehended.</p>

    <p>Writing allows the writer to express their feelings, thoughts, or share knowledge. Both reading and writing
        require creativity. You express emotion(s) through writing, and you experience
        emotion(s) through reading.</p>

    <!-- Personal opinion: I think that people lack literacy comprehension and that affects the ability to empathize with others. A lot of my friends seem to think of reading as a boring activity, but I think it’s a great way to pass time and to escape from reality through the experiences of others.  -->
